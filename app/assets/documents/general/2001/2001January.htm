<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SCHEDULE – Traci is looking for an EMT to join her &amp; Rhonda on the schedule for the Saturday, Jan. 27 a.m. shift.  Mietta volunteered.    She also asked everyone to review January’s calendar, as there are still some &quot;out of service&quot; shifts.  February’s calendar was distributed during the meeting.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dirk is sending an email to everyone inviting them to join </FONT><A HREF="mailto:Groups@AOL"><FONT SIZE=2>Groups@AOL</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STATE COMM – When you are toned-out by State Comm, make sure that all of your team has responded before you leave home; if not, landline State Comm and have them re-tone the team members who have not responded.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FAMILY SUPPORT—Beth Chandler discussed a card she had printed to be used by the EMT’s when a call results in a need for family support due to loss of a family member, etc.  The card (which should be completed &amp; left with the family) lists resources for support groups &amp; also the name &amp; phone number of the EMT on call.

She mentioned that  we need an SOP Committee &amp; that Nance Cooper expressed interest in being on this Committee.  She also mentioned the insurance information that the Team Leaders are currently gathering from all members.  Bill Bishop mentioned that the County is working with ICRMP to cover volunteers’ personal vehicles being driven to an ambulance call in a &quot;primary&quot; fashion.  Further discussion ensued regarding this insurance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FUND RAISING COMMITTEE REPORT--  Beth Gorringe &amp; Maureen Ericksen reported on the current activities of the Fund Raising Committee. Tentative plans are as follows:  Southwest Airlines donated two round trip tickets that will be used for a Classic car rally.  The idea is to contact car clubs to bring their cars for display, charging them $10-$20, and whichever car is voted best by the general public, will win the two airline tickets.  This is planned for sometime in June, 2001.  They will also be soliciting for other prizes for raffles and there will be a concession stand.  Potential location: Robie Creek park or Spring Shores Marina.  Drew Bodie suggested that the committee check with the other fire departments, etc., in the area, so we are not overlapping dates of fundraising events.  Jeff Pape mentioned that he knew several people who may be interested in bringing their cars &amp; Traci suggested he get together with the Committee on this.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RADIOS – Traci mentioned that Ron Knopp of Mountain Search &amp; Rescue may have some used radios for us.  We have asked for 50 &amp; once they pass inspection, we’ll at least get the first 15.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRAINING--  Bill Bishop followed with Radio Operations/Communications Training.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There being no further business, the meeting adjourned at 9:00 p.m.</P>
