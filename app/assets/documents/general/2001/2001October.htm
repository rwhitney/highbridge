<P>MORES CREEK AMBULANCE REGULAR MEMBER MEETING</P>
<P>October 16, 2001</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beth Chandler called the Regular Member Meeting of Mores Creek Ambulance to order at 6:50 p.m. The meeting was held at the Mores Creek Ambulance Building.  Officers present: Beth Chandler, President, Carol Riazzi, Secretary/Treasurer and Bren Parkhurst, Secretary/Treasurer-elect. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#ff0000"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Members present: Maureen Ericksen, Terry Acker, Gus Catherman, Kimberly Tkacs, Karen Acker, Wes Towle, Rusty Ambrose, John McCarthy, Teresa Snyder, Suzanna Smith, Reggie Boyle, Tiffany Brown, Keith Oliver, Doug Trosky, Dave McGlone, Rhonda Grindstaff &amp; Jennifer Stolley.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GUESTS &amp; NEW/PROSPECTIVE MEMBERS – Beth introduced Reggie Boyle, who will be driving for the unit &amp; is planning to take the Fall EMT class; and Tiffany Brown, who is a student at NNU, she also will be driving for now &amp; is currently in an EMT class at CPR Connection.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OCTOBER/NOVEMBER CALENDARS --- Karen is passing around the October and November calendars for shift sign-up.  If there is anyone who can fill some of the remaining open shifts in October, it would be most appreciated.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SEPTEMBER MEETING MINUTES --- A motion was made by Wes &amp; seconded by John to approve the minutes of the September 18 Regular Member Meeting as distributed.  The motion was carried by all.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TREASURER’S REPORT – Beth mentioned that the Treasurer’s Report is distributed every month by Carol Riazzi, Secretary/Treasurer, to Boise County and the Executive Board.  Any member is welcome to review these reports at any time.  We will have more income coming in from the raffle, but our current balance is $3,555.08, which is not enough to purchase the Stryker Gurney &amp; pay our current monthly bills. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW EQUIPMENT --  The Board made a motion at their last meeting to purchase an inflatable child seat at an estimated cost of $200-$300.  Additionally, there are now wheel chocks, bolt cutters, a tow rope &amp; a come-along in the ambulance.  The trainers will be doing some training on these items in the future.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW RADIOS – We have received 10 new radios, which have been distributed to the members who take the most shifts.  A couple of these new radios will also be located at the ambulance building.   </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RECENT CALLS --- Beth discussed a call last month of an elderly woman who had fallen over an embankment.  She had recent knee reconstruction surgery &amp; apparently popped a bone on the reconstructed knee.  Maureen discussed a patient with a tib fib break in Clear Creek, who did not want to be transported since he did not have insurance.  The important point of the call was that we need to talk to bystanders to get their input, since the patient never mentioned that he had been hit on the head with the backhoe bucket.  Rhonda discussed a recent gunshot call where radio transmissions were inappropriate (using names over the radio).</P>
