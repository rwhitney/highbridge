<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AMBULANCE UPDATE --  Terry Acker reported on the following:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>He is taking the ambulance to Boise Mobile tomorrow to have the chain pans installed.  This will eliminate the problem with the chains dragging on the road.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Plug-in – Needs to be twisted to the &quot;lock&quot; position (about a 10 degree turn) for the plug-in to work.  Listen for the fan in the cab of the ambulance to make sure it is working properly.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Chain operation – The ambulance needs to be moving (approximately 5 to 10 mph) to activate the chains.  You shouldn’t drive over 35 mph with the chains activated.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Four-wheel drive – you can shift from 4H to 2H when moving, but you must be stopped &amp; in neutral or park to switch from 4H to 4L.</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ADVISORY BOARD UPDATE – Dirk reported on the following:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Ambulance Radio—The radio is in &amp; will be installed by Mountain West next week.  It is a Kenwood TK790—operates as 2 separate units for the driver &amp; for the EMTs working in the back.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>PCR’s --- The County needs to have the transport mileage included on the PCR’s for billing purposes.  Anyone returning the ambulance to the building should reset the odometer to &quot;0&quot; for this purpose.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Improvements – A longer extension cord will be installed to the plug-in; heavy wire baskets will also be mounted on the ambulance bulkheads for the PCR clipboard &amp; mapbook.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Diesel cards – The County has changed fueling procedures.  The tanks in the County yard have been decommissioned.  The County contracted with CFN (Commercial Fueling Network) for purchasing fuel.  There is a master card in the visor of the ambulance---put this card in, insert unit # &amp; mileage.  Then, put the individual member card in, along with the PIN #.  These fuel cards were distributed to select members based on level of activity.  Margie offered her card to be kept in the ambulance.  The County asks that we discontinue purchasing fuel from non-CFN stations.</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW MEMBER ORIENTATION (Karen Acker) – Karen discussed the issue of driver orientation becoming over-burdened with ancillary questions.  She’s suggesting a mentoring program by the Team Leader or some other Team Member familiar with MCA operations.  She distributed a checkoff list for new unit members &amp; is asking for suggestions to this list.  This is a &quot;work in progress&quot; in an attempt to incorporate new members easily.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DECEMBER MEETING --  Beth mentioned that the Board discussed several options for the December Member meeting.  The suggestion is that the new teams get together to select a leader for next year and discuss how the team concept can be more useful. All teams need to get together before the December 18 meeting.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SAFETY &amp; SURVIVAL KIT --- Gus discussed the two new survival packs that will be in the ambulance, in the event a member is required to pack in to a scene (snowmobile accident, hunting accident, etc.).  If there is anything missing that you feel should be included, please contact Gus or Karen.  Billie suggested including Fritos (they’re very flammable and are also a food source).</P>

There is also a key for the front door in the black lockbox under the leg of the first peopane tank behind the building.  Gus also mentioned that when locking the door if a tone sounds for 5 seconds, it means that the battery is low.  Please contact John McCarthy to replace the battery.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LANDING ZONE ON HIGHWAY 21, MM 21 – John McCarthy discussed the fact that the owner of the current LZ does not want the trees cut or moved.  John subsequently met with the representative of the Department of Transportation to start the process of obtaining a right-of-way near the old LZ for the new site.   A letter of approval is required from Life Flight.  No fill is required, but we will need to dump some gravel.  The DOT will install &quot;no parking&quot; signs at the site.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IMMUNIZATIONS – The County requires us to have HEPB, TB &amp; flu shots.
