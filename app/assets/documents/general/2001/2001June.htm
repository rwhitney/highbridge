<P>MORES CREEK AMBULANCE REGULAR MEMBER MEETING</P>
<P>June 19, 2001</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beth Chandler called the Regular Member Meeting of Mores Creek Ambulance to order at 6:52 p.m. The meeting was held at the Mores Creek Ambulance Building.  Officers present: Beth Chandler, President, Dirk Myers, Vice President &amp; EBCA Advisory Board, Carol Riazzi, Secretary/Treasurer and Bren Parkhurst, Secretary/Treasurer-elect. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#ff0000"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Members present: Beve Doolittle, Maureen Ericksen, John McCarthy, Dave McGlone, Terry Acker, Rhonda Grindstaff, Gus Catherman, Doug Trosky, Tim Schaaf, Kimberly Tkacs and Margie Jones.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MINUTES OF LAST REGULAR MEMBER MEETING --  John McCarthy moved &amp; Margie Jones seconded the motion to approve the minutes of the May 15, 2001 Regular Member Meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WEBSITE -- Terry Acker mentioned that there are a few basic pages available now and that Joan McCarthy has a developer working on the calendar.  The website domain name is: mcaems.org.  Anyone who has appropriate links to be added should contact Terry.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEIGHBORHOOD VISIBILITY PROJECT -- Dirk discussed two challenges facing MCA---fundraising and recruiting.  We have an idea that will serve both purposes --  During a 12 hour shift, the on-call crew might want to spend 1-2 hours going door to door with the ambulance, introducing MCA and passing out our brochure to homeowners in local neighborhoods.  Discussion ensued regarding a map that would be broken out into quadrants to avoid duplication of efforts, time of the day that homeowners are most available (evenings may be better), ride tickets (similar to a Life Flight membership---$25 purchases a free ambulance transport--good for one year).  This will also help members familiarize themselves with the area.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BOISE COUNTY BUDGET -- Margie &amp; Joe Weiss are working on the 2002 budget.  MCA has submitted a request for: re-studding our winter tires and a new radio for the ambulance.  We were also considering a base station for the ambulance building, but we will most likely have to count on our own fundraising efforts for this purchase.  Via grants, we have also requested 10 radios &amp; an inflatable child seat, along with a Fall EMT Basic class, First Responder Class, First Aid Class &amp; CPR class.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SCHEDULE -- Beve distributed the July schedule for shift selection, along with an up-to-date June schedule.  Due to the Rainbow People's meeting in Lowman, all four of our units will be responsible for coverage, if needed.  It is important that we have as many shifts covered as possible between now and July 10.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">APPLICATION PROCESS --  The application process was defined at the last Executive Board Meeting as follows:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Application is completed &amp; turned in to either the President or Secretary/Treasurer.  Included with the application should be copies of the applicant's driver's license, EMT and CPR certifications and personal vehicle insurance information (Insurance Company &amp; policy #).&#9;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Secretary/Treasurer submits request to County for drivers check</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>President contacts references</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>President or Vice President schedules interview after all checks are complete.  The interview board shall consist of at least 3 members from the Board, Team Leaders &amp;/or Trainers (and any other unit member interested in attending).</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Candidates will be notified AFTER this meeting within 24-48 hours, unless additional information is required.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Accepted members will be assigned a Team Leader, advised how to schedule driver training &amp; how to get on the schedule.</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BY-LAWS, SOP'S &amp; MEMBER HANDBOOK -- We were informed that we need to obtain approval from the Boise County Commissioners before these are distributed to the membership.  A copy was given to them on June 7.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CALL JUMPING -- It's O.K.  to jump a call, but you need to stay in the background &amp; let the on-call crew handle the patient.  Too many EMT's in a patient's face causes more distress to the patient.  It was suggested that you listen for responding members and the nature of the call---if the call requires no more than the on-call crew, stand down.  If the crew needs additional help, they can call in to State Comm for assistance.  We need to project a professional image.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SHOVEL PARTY --- Beth asked if anyone would be available to help move some of the dirt at the ambulance building to appease a complaining neighbor.  Plans were to meet at 6:30/6:45 p.m. on Thursday, June 21.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WATER RESCUE CLASS --- Kim Tkacs has scheduled a Water Rescue Class at Spring Shores on July 14 at 1:00 p.m.  </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#ff0000">Please let Kim know if you will be able to attend</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.  Beth will check with Idaho City to see if they want to join us.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IDAHO CITY AMBULANCE BUILDING COMBINATION ---It has changed again--it is now: 1-4-3.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRAINING--  Ryan Berkheiser of CPR Connection commenced AED (Automated External Defibrillator) training at 7:20 p.m.  Ryan reviewed the use of our AED and ran through several scenarios with attendees. He also demonstrated the use of other (more modern) AED's----our model is an antique!!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PRESENTATION TO TRACI KINSMAN --- In honor of her many years of service to MCA and for getting the unit back up &amp; running, Traci Kinsman was presented with a gift certificate for a massage at Rapunzel's.  Talk to Beth about the reciprocal gift she received from Traci!!!</P>
