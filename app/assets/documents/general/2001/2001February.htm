<P>MORES CREEK AMBULANCE REGULAR MEMBER MEETING</P>
<P>February 20, 2001</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Traci Kinsman called the Regular Member Meeting of Mores Creek Ambulance to order at 7:06 p.m. The meeting was held at the Mores Creek Ambulance Building. Those officers present were: Traci Kinsman, President; Beth Chandler, President-elect; and Carol Riazzi, Secretary/Treasurer. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#ff0000"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Members present: Maureen Ericksen, Beth Gorringe, John McCarthy, Dave McGlone, Karen &amp; Terry Acker, Rhonda Grindstaff,  Kimberly Tkacs, Gus Catherman, and Margie Jones.  Tim Franklin, a prospective member, was also in attendance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STRATEGIC PLAN – Beth Chandler discussed the need for a Strategic Plan for the unit.  Input from the membership is needed on a Mission Statement.  Beth read Boise County’s mission statement.  The Team Leaders convened for 5 minutes with their groups to draft Mission Statements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CHAIR DRIVE – Beth also reiterated the idea of donating a chair for the Ambulance Building that you can have your name placed on the back of the chair as a &quot;signature&quot; donation.  The ultimate goal is to have the meeting room converted into a classroom for future EMT classes, etc.  Beth brought a stacking chair she found at COSTCO---cost is $18.  Members can either buy chairs, or we’ll have to set aside some fundraising dollars to purchase chairs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#ff0000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SCHEDULE – Beth contacted State Comm to determine the days of the week (over the last 2 years) that all four East Boise County Ambulance (EBCA) units experienced the most calls.  24/7 just doesn’t seem feasible for us until we have more EMT’s.  The results were: Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays &amp; Sundays.  Followed by Wednesdays, then Mondays and Tuesdays.  We need to come up with some creative solutions, e.g., splitting 12 hour shifts or having someone cover for you for a few hours during a 12 hour shift.  Boise County experiences a large number of visitors year round.  A possible solution is to concentrate more fully on the Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday shifts first---the number of EMT shifts to cover just Saturday &amp; Sundays in a month = 32 EMT’s and 16 drivers. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MAP TRAINING – Beth is also suggesting that once the roads are clear of snow &amp; ice that some Saturday (possibly in May), that we have a road rally/scavenger hunt to help acquaint members with addresses in Boise County, while also having some fun.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RACE TO ROBIE CREEK – If you’re interested in participating as part of the Mores Creek unit on race day, mark your calendars for April 21.  Jim Cooper has notified the Race Committee that we’re back in service and plan to be involved.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AMBULANCE KEYS – The ambulance is now located directly outside of the Ambulance Building and is locked.  The keys are in the building on the easel (everyone should know the combination to enter the building!!).  We plan to obtain some spare keys.  Terry Acker also suggested that we obtain a magnetic &quot;hide a key&quot; box to store a key in case they are accidentally locked inside the ambulance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">REFUELING – The ambulance tanks need to be ¾ full at all times.  If you go to Idaho City or Boise to refuel, call State Comm to let them know that you are refueling and will be out of the service area, but will still respond if toned.   Margie gave directions to the &quot;free&quot; Boise County refueling center in Idaho City:  Turn left off of Highway I21 onto Montgomery St.; turn left onto Centerville Road, then left onto Buena Vista Rd. (see sign for Pioneer Cemetery).  Continue on Buena Vista, until you see the County’s fenced-in yard on the right.  The fuel tanks are behind the building.  Be sure to use DIESEL --- the keys for the diesel tank are on the gearshift in the ambulance (red key).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EBCA ADVISORY BOARD MEETINGS – All members are welcome to attend these meetings in Idaho City---they are &quot;normally&quot; held on the first Thursday of each month.</P>

The Committee’s responsibilities were discussed, in that they are responsible for presenting ideas to the membership, assembling the framework for a successful fundraiser and then soliciting the help of the  membership to complete tasks.  They will report at the next Membership Meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RECRUITING TEAM--- Traci discussed the need for a Master Recruiter to oversee the process of distributing &amp; monitoring applications, setting up interviews, monitoring background checks &amp; scheduling driver training.  Anyone interested should contact their Team Leader.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW OSHA CLASS REQUIREMENT --- Margie Jones discussed a new OSHA environmental emergency class requirement for all emergency medical (EMT’s and drivers and Fire Department) personnel.  This is an 8 hour awareness class.  The target date is April 14---Margie is to check &amp; report back.  Margie also mentioned the Boise Fire Training Center class on Thursday, the 22<SUP>nd</SUP> for the current EMT class.  Location is 1620 N. Liberty; between 9 &amp; 9:30.</P>
