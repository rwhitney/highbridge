DRAFT MCA GENERAL/TRAINING MEETING NOTES
JUNE 20, 2002

START:  7:31 p.m.

FUNDRAISING:  The rummage sale will be July 20 at Hilltop Cafe. A signup
sheet was circulated to help with tasks.  If you want to help but were not
at the meeting, contact Maureen Ericksen or your team leader.  Please save
your stuff, but no clothing this year.  Terry and a few others have vehicles
that can haul large objects if you need help with that.

UNIFORMS: The Board decided to purchase a unit t-shirt for each member. The
shirts are 50% cotton/50% polyester. Let your team leader know if you prefer
Jade or Navy and what size you wear. The majority of members approved a
motion to have the back of the shirts say Mores Creek Ambulance EMS on the
back (Motion: Maureen Ericksen, Second: Renee Johansson).  Shorts are ok for
summer, just remember to bring pants or a jumpsuit for your own safety.  On
a related note, two extrication suits are in the budget for next year.

SHIFT CALENDAR: Team leaders will be getting involved in helping members
sign up.  The Board is trying to address some of the issues brought up by
out-of-the-area volunteers recently.  As a first step, some food items have
been stocked at the shed.  Remember to date stuff when you open it, so we
know when it is time for items to be disposed of.

WILDERNESS RANCH FUNDRAISER: Wilderness Ranch Volunteer Fire and Rescue is
having their annual fundraiser the afternoon of July 13, 12:00-6:00. MCA has
been asked to participate.  The unit will have a table with brochures and
ride tickets. One of the traditions is an auction, so if anyone has items to
donate, contact Peggy B.  John McCarthy can tell you how to reach her.

UPCOMING TRAINING:
*	July--water rescue at Spring Shores Marina (Denise ?)
*	August--personal/family disaster preparedness (Mietta Siebert)
*	September--awards banquet for members and spouses/significant others
*	October--ropes rescue training (Dave Ockerman, Ada County
Paramedics)

UNIT VALUES: In a continued effort to build unit morale, we will be
revisiting one of each of our core unit values each month.  As a reminder,
MCA's core values are unity, compassion, professionalism, and integrity.
This month the focus is on unity.  Thus the barbeque before the meeting.
Another idea is to invite previous members to future meetings.  The unit
will probably have a potluck prior to each meeting from now on. A unit
newsletter will be published at some point.  Bring ideas for unity to the
group. Be proactive and solution oriented. It was suggested that we invite
the Commissioners, the Medical Director, LifeFlight, State EMS, the Sheriff,
and State Comm representatives to the awards banquet (and future meetings).

QUALITY IMPROVEMENT: Members were reminded to take time after each call to
review what went well and what could be improved. Jan suggested a
pre-incident stress education course and peer review training to help with
tough calls.

CALL REVIEW: Four recent calls were reviewed, all of them motor vehicle
trauma-related.  Great teamwork between Robie Creek Fire, Wilderness Ranch
Fire & Rescue and MCA members on their recent extrication call.  PCR
REMINDER: Please check the clipboard to make sure extra Patient Care Reports
are in the clipboard in the ambulance.  The big stack of extra PCR's is in
the top drawer of the file cabinet.

TREASURER'S REPORT: The accounts are in reasonable shape. The official
report will be sent out later.

BIOHAZARD MATERIAL: If you have biohazard material after a call but the
patient is transported by another agency, the material needs to go to the
hospital.  There may be a rule that says that biohazard containers cannot be
transported in privately owned vehicles.  Doug Trosky and Jan Peterson will
try to find out.

NEW MAP BOOK: The new map book contains all of East Boise County. The old
one is still in the ambulance on the bottom shelf of the passenger side
front compartment if you need it.

AWARDS: Mietta was recognized for signing up for shifts through August.
Renee was recognized for vacuuming the shed.  Karen said she hadn't heard
from anyone asking to recognize other members.  Let her know if there is
someone who needs to be recognized.  Someone with access to the new awards
software will send a certificate of appreciation to Dave and Jennifer Haney
(?) from Robie Creek Fire for their contribution of hamburgers to the unit.

PEDIATRIC FIRST AID: Jan is teaching a pediatric first aid class at the
shed, Sunday, June 23, from  9:00 a.m. until done (no later than 5:00). Let
her know if you want to attend.

SPLINTING TRAINING (interesting photos and demonstrations, too):
*	First think of scene safety
*	Avoid tunnel vision on the injury
*	If a joint is injured, splint the bones above and below the joint
*	If a bone is injured, splint the joints above and below the injury
*	Remove the patient's jewelry if it is in the area to be splinted
*	Monitor circulation frequently
*	Beware of dimples, compare both sides
*	Be careful with ice--if you leave it on too long, you can create
frostbite
*	Closed traumas can be a challenge; monitor the ABC's carefully.
*	With children, call for air ambulance if there is an epiphyseal
break--quick treatment can help prevent long-term damage to bones
*	Kold wrap and vet wrap are some of Jan's favorite products
*	The Red Cross has a great splinting course
