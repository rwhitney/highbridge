MORES CREEK AMBULANCE
GENERAL/TRAINING MEETING NOTES
MAY 16, 2002

START:  6:45 p.m. social/dinner time, followed by business and training

APPROVE APRIL MINUTES: Motion--Nancy Bishop, Second--Terry Acker
Majority verbal vote to approve the April General/Training Minutes.

APPROVE TREASURER'S REPORT:  Approximately $3,500 in the account.
Motion--Dirk Myers, Second--Terry Acker, majority voted to accept the
report. 

ADVISORY BOARD UPDATE: Beth gave an update from the May Advisory Board
meeting on the following topics:
1. SOP's for the County will be available soon. In the meantime, we will
continue using ours.
2. The County wants to choose Ambulance Advisory Board members. We can
recommend a unit representative, and the County has the final say. Also, if
we send a substitute for our Advisory Board Member, the substitute needs to
be on a list of names previously sent to the County in order to vote.  Terry
Acker, John McCarthy, and Beth Chandler agreed to be on the list as
substitutes.
3. The County budget was reviewed and Beth reminded us of the items we had
requested funding for.
4. We received feedback about radio communications on a recent call. We were
reminded to turn off the ambulance at the Emergency Rooms so fumes don't go
into the hospital buildings. Also, there was some discussion about whether
or not the gurney should be in the loading position when moving patients.
Remember to think about where the ambulance headlights are pointing at
night, e.g., not at the Sheriff's car.

AWARD FOR DIRK MYERS: Beth presented Dirk Myers with golden trauma shears on
a nasal cannula lanyard, a certificate of appreciation, and a card signed by
members at the meeting to thank him for his service to MCA. He will be
around indefinitely before the move to Indiana is final.

FUNDRAISING UPDATE: A letter was sent to members recently asking them for
feedback about fundraising and their willingness to help. Very few responses
were received, but some members at the meeting said they hadn't received the
letter yet. The next fundraising meeting will be Thursday, May 23, at 6:30
at the ambulance building to decide if there is enough interest to hold the
yard sale, the turtle race, or both.

UNIT MORALE: Billie Butler reviewed some of her ideas for building unit
morale that she had offered at the May MCA Board Meeting on May 1.  She will
be publishing a newsletter when her computer is working again, talked about
ideas for recognizing members, and suggested allowing members to choose
their preferred contact method in case they do not use e-mail regularly.

MISCELLANEOUS: The State EMS Conference is May 31 and June 1. If three or
more unit members sign up, the fee is reduced. This is a reimbursable
training expense.  Nancy Bishop goes by St. Luke's every day before and
after work. Let her know if we have equipment there, and she will pick it
up.

REVIEW OF RECENT CALLS: Three calls were discussed prior to training.
1. Karen and Terry heard participated in a call the weekend they took the
Special Ops ropes rescue class. As it turned out, the Special Ops Team was
called to help retrieve two patients from the opposite side of the creek.
Wilderness Ranch Fire and Rescue helped set up lights on scene.  This was a
long one in the middle of the night.  Patients were hypothermic and did not
appear to have other serious injuries.

2. Billie had a combative head injury patient at a motocross race in
Wyoming. The patient was a bit aggressive, so she had bystanders help. The
patient had fixed and dilated pupils, shattered a scapula, and had a
previous neck injury.

3. There was a single vehicle rollover with five patients. Placerville
helped with this one.

HELP THURSDAY NEXT WEEK: There is a Governor's conference next week and we
need to be in service during the day shift because Idaho City is busy
covering the conference.  Karen can be EMT until 3:00 p.m. but needs a
driver and an EMT for the rest of the shift.

EXTRICATION/AIR BAG TRAINING: John McCarthy reviewed scene size up and
reminded us of other resources that we can tap into on MVA or other
challenging calls. Kevin Bechen, the Safety Director of the Idaho Department
of Highway
Safety, Grants Department, was our guest and observed the training, which is
one of the requirement for our air bag grant.  Some highlights follow:
* Call out Wilderness Ranch Fire and Rescue for any vehicle-related calls.
It's better to have them on the way and tell them to turn back than to not
have them available.
* John gave an example from a recent call in which the patient had been in
an MVA, then was put into a bystander's automobile and moved to get help. He
talked about some of the risks in this kind of situation.
* Remember that it is the Boise County Sheriff's job to clear the highway
during traffic accidents. If you need them to do something else, you can
ask.
* If you need help, call State Comm and tell them the situation you're in
and the kind of resources you need. They can find the resources for you. 
* Remember that the Sheriff has to authorize the use of other resources.  If
a Sheriff or a Deputy is on scene, let him/her know what you need, so it
isn't a surprise.
* Scene size up begins when you get the call over the radio.
* Ask for whatever you think you might need while you have radio contact.
You may not be able to ask for resources later because of dead spots with
the radios.
* Protect yourself, and don't take unnecessary risks.
* We have a set of turnout gear on the ambulance now. Use it.
* Protect the scene and your work area. Position the ambulance
appropriately.
* Establish an Incident Commander.
* Watch out for "loaded" bumpers on cars--bumpers that have been impacted.
They can be released with a lot of energy and cause serious injuries. Always
try to approach damaged vehicles from the side to avoid the bumpers.
* Our service area includes a narrow highway with power lines. When power
lines touch the ground, there is a ground gradient with different levels of
power that diminish from the source. If you feel tingling in an area with
downed power lines, do shuffle steps to get away. If you take regular steps
your body might become the path for current to travel between two areas with
different electrical levels.
* Watch out for unreleased air bags, the restraint kind used in automobiles,
not the kind we learned to use in the training for extrication purposes.
Air bag power systems can hold a charge for a while, even after battery
cables are cut.  The best thing to do is to keep yourself away from them.
* Attendees moved to the setup with the extrication trucks and airbags and
learned how to use them. Jim Bryant jumped in as a trainer for this part.  
 
ADJOURN: Approximately 9:00 p.m. as attendees finished training.
