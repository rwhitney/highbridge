<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Dirk,
     John, Nancy and Doug responded to call at Arrowrock. Two guys drove off
     the cliff into the lake. Upon arrival one patient was found approximately
     mile marker 9 in a boat on the back of a trailer. The other patient was
     nowhere around. Upon further investigation, he was found about 2 miles up
     the lake still in the water. With the sheriff’s assistance, it turned into
     a water rescue. As it turns out the two patients had stayed in their
     vehicle until it had completely filled with water then tried to evacuate.
     Life flight airlifted both patients.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Karen,
     Terry, Mietta and Billy responded to a call at Spring Shores. Man fell off
     cliff, about 25-foot drop, then 1.5-foot diameter rock fell onto his butt
     fracturing his pelvis. He was in a large amount of pain. Life flight
     airlifted him.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Kim,
     Terry, Eric and Karen responded to Spring Shores Marina. Man fell off bow
     of Bayliner. The boat went overtop of him and the prop sliced his ankle.
     Medic in marina was first responder and wrapped ankle. MCA transported him
     to area ER.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Karen,
     Terry and Billie responded to 4-wheeler rollover at Daggett Creek ridge.
     Patient was firefighter trying to access fire on ATV and it rolled.
     Complained of pain in foot and knee. Applied wrap and transported to area
     ER.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Beth,
     Gus and Jim responded to Spring Shores Marina. Man ran his jet ski into a
     rock wall. He reported having two beers. Life flight was called but
     unknown who dispatched them.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Doug
     reported of a 4-wheeler rollover in Robie Creek area. Because of a bad
     address, it was hard to find the accident scene. State Comm. finally got
     the correct address to Doug and they were able to respond. One passenger
     was lifeflighted and other passenger was transported by ambulance to area
     ER.</li>

<p class=MsoNormal>ADDITIONAL CALL REPORT INFORMATION: </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>For
     future calls to Arrowrock and/or Spring Shores, remember that most patients
     are already out of the water by the time we arrive. Gather as much
     information as possible on how they got out of the water. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>Always
     evaluate yourself after every call.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>If
     toned out, make sure State Comm. knows you’re responding even if it means
     finding a landline. State Comm. has new employees and because they don’t
     always answer your response, you don’t know for sure that they’ve heard
     you. Plus their acknowledgement needs to be heard by the other members of
     your team so they know you’re coming.</li>
