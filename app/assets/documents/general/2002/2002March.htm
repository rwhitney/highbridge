MORES CREEK AMBULANCE
GENERAL/TRAINING MEETING NOTES
MARCH 20, 2002

START:  6:50 p.m.

APPROVE FEBRUARY MINUTES: Motion--Wes Towle, Second--Terry Acker
Majority verbal vote to approve the February General/Training Minutes.

TREASURER'S REPORT:  $4,599 in the account.

AED INFORMATION: Gus has information about Allegiance, a medical supply
business on Emerald. We are collecting information to submit a grant
application for a $1,000 AED grant sponsored by Prudential.  Doug Trosky
will check with a Red Cross representative to find out what has happened to
all of the AED's that were used at the Olympics in Salt Lake City.

THANK YOU FOR DONATION: A thank you letter was sent to Stephanie Johnson for
her contribution to the unit.

FUNDRAISING: Next committee meeting is March 26, 6:30 p.m., Dirk and Bren's.
The yard sale will be held in June.  Please start saving your stuff.

RACE TO ROBIE CREEK: The race is April 20. We need EMT's, drivers, quads,
and jump kits. The unit has received a $1,500 donation in the past for
supporting the Race. A suggestion was made to see if the Race to Robie Creek
organization would donate an AED in lieu of a check. Beth is hosting a
barbeque at her home for MCA volunteers after the race.

NON-MEMBER MISUSING EMS STATUS: There has been a report of someone driving
on Highway 21 with a light bar on a gold pickup (possibly a Dodge) with Ada
County license plates. This person has been using Jim Bryant's portable
numbers over the radio. Please let the Sheriff's Office know if and when you
see this person.

UPCOMING TRAINING: Extrication class--April 14, 10:00 a.m., in the Landing
Zone/Turnout near Dunnigan Creek Road and Highway 21. Ropes training with
Ada County Special Operations Team--May 3-5, $150, prepayment is requested. 

EMERGENCY DRIVING STATS: Karen found some data in a recent newsletter from
State Comm that said 30+ EMT's are in jail on manslaughter charges in the
U.S. because of accidents caused when they ran red lights.  The lesson for
us is that we really don't need to run code.

REPORTING SUPPLIES USAGE ON PATIENT CARE REPORTS: The County will be asking
us to provide a description of what each supply is used for on the back of
the Patient Care Reports.  There is a price list for supplies that will be
left at the shed. More information on this at a future meeting.

ROBIE CREEK CAFE FIRE TRAINING: Robie Creek and Wilderness Ranch Volunteer
Fire Departments will conduct a training exercise and finish burning the
former Robie Creek Cafe building on April 6. EMT's are needed to take
firefighter vital signs throughout the morning.  Let Ackers know if you can
be there to help.

UPDATE ON REWARD SYSTEM: A member reward system was discussed at the last
Board meeting (March). Any member can nominate any other member. A software
package and certificates have been ordered. Karen put together an Awards
Basket with items like shears, emergency blankets, and gift certificates.
There will also be "bigger" merit-based awards in the future.  The first
award (gift certificate and chocolates) was given to Gus Catherman. 

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES: A few minor wording changes have been made to
the SOP's. The document is available on the web site. Karen will leave a
copy in the shed. We will vote on the SOP's at the April meeting.

MEETING SCHEDULES: The majority of members present at this meeting prefer
Thursday for the general/training meeting, so we will continue with it on
the 3rd Thursday of each month.

AIR AMBULANCE SERVICE: St. Luke's will have an air ambulance soon. Access
Air is in question.  More information will be provided when it becomes
available.  When we need air ambulance service, we are supposed to as State
Comm and they will give us information about who is available and in what
time frame. We can choose which service to use if more than one is
available, or the patient can choose.

SHED LINEN: If you use linens at the shed, please take them home and launder
them, or ask someone who lives in the area to help.

SKED TRAINING: The SKED is in the bright orange bag. There is a handle in
front and straps for helicopter lifts. Put a blanket underneath the patient
because it really conducts cold. Consider injuries and the direction you
load them in. Be aware that patients may get claustrophobic when they are
strapped in completely.

FUEL: The Chief of Robie Creek Volunteer Fire said we could put a fuel tank
on the ground at Station #2 if we were interested in having one there.

ADJOURN: 8:05 p.m. Motion--Carol, Second--Beth, majority agreed.
