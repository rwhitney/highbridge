MORES CREEK AMBULANCE
GENERAL/TRAINING MEETING NOTES
APRIL 18, 2002

START:  6:50 p.m.

APPROVE MARCH MINUTES: Motion--John Nesbit, Second--Karen Acker
Majority verbal vote to approve the February General/Training Minutes.

FUNDRAISING UPDATE: Beth looked for information on rubber duck races on the
Internet and found quite a bit.  Races range in size from 400 ducks to
700,000 ducks, and all of them make money.  There is a rubber turtle race
for groups just starting out with this kind of fund raising.  Logistics
still need to be worked out.  The next fundraising meeting is a week from
next Tuesday [April 30].

TREASURER'S REPORT:  Approximately $4,500 in the account.

HOT/COLD RESPONSE:  A recent newsletter from State Comm says that they will
dispatch us as a "hot" or "cold" response.  Typically, we will have "cold"
responses.  The implication is that lights/sirens/high speeds are not
necessary.

AED INFORMATION: STAT Medical recently merged with Marsh Medical in
Portland. They gave us a lead on discounted AED's left over from the winter
Olympics.  They come with full warranties. Motion to purchase one of these
AED's with MCA funds if the County does not do it: Doug Trosky, Second:
Terry Acker. Majority approved. Beth will talk to Phyllis about ordering.  

INVENTORY: Beth will be doing inventory next weekend of items on the
ambulance that are County assets. John volunteered himself and his shift
partners to work on it also. The list is on the top mail slot on the desk in
the shed. 

RACE TO ROBIE CREEK: The race is this Saturday, April 20. It is supposed to
be cool, 55-60 degrees. If you're signed up to help, dress in layers. Bring
the following: rain gear, food, water, jump kit, oxygen.  Beth is hosting a
barbeque at her home for MCA volunteers after the race.  Jan gave a quick
summary of what to expect during the race, which could be anything depending
on the weather and the level of training the race participants have. As
usual, be prepared and take care of yourself first, so you can help others.
In the past, there have been patients with cardiac conditions, diabetic
reactions, etc. This year there is a viral condition that is still going
around that may affect some participants. Look for folks who have "spackled
syndrome"--they will look blotchy or have white or red spots all over.  This
indicates a lack of circulation. Beth will make copies of the list of things
the Race committee says to watch for. In general, do not try to help
participants unless they are down or ask for help.

SOP's APPROVED: No discussion on changes to SOP's. Motion to accept the
SOP's: Terry Acker, Second: John Nesbit. Majority approved by verbal vote.

EMT's FOR MOTOCROSS HELP: Billie Butler may have a need for EMT's to help at
some motocross races this spring and summer. A few positions are paid, but
the main incentive will probably be admission to the event and the
opportunity to practice. Volunteers provide their own jump kits. Billie
tallies up the supplies that are used and gets reimbursed for all of them.
Contact Billie if you are interested in helping.

AED TRAINING: Doug Trosky provided AED training. We watched a video that
reviewed the following topics: 4 links in the chain of survival, the heart's
electrical system, different types of AED's, and how to use the AED.  The
following is a list of key items to remember with AED use:
* Do not use the AED in an oxygen-enriched environment; remove oxygen from
the patient for shocking
* Do not use in a wet environment or with the patient on a metal surface
* Idaho protocol says the patient must be 12 years old or 90 pounds for AED
use
* Check circulation for up to 10 seconds
* Make sure the patient's chest is bare and dry
* Remove nitro patches and nicotine patches WITH GLOVES
* Remove necklaces, dangling earrings, under wire bras
* Avoid placing pads on collar bones or over pace makers
* Keep the patient still, do not move or touch when using the AED
* Stand clear when the device is analyzing and shocking
* The patient's arms should NOT be touching metal, e.g., parts of the gurney
* The pads should be positioned so that you can visualize a straight line
from one pad to the other
* The American Red Cross says not to use alcohol pads; if you do, because
that's what we have, wipe off the area with towel or tissue
* Do not use cell phones or transmit via two-way radios within six feet of
the AED


ADJOURN: 8:30-9:00 p.m. as attendees finished training.
