DRAFT MCA BOARD MEETING NOTES
MAY 1, 2002

START: 6:40 p.m.

Board Members Present: Terry Acker, Nancy Bishop, Beth Chandler, Rhonda
Grindstaff
Officers and Members:  Karen Acker, Billie Butler, Maureen Eriksen, John
Nesbit

APPROVE APRIL MINUTES: Motion to approve April minutes-John Nesbit,
Second--Terry Acker. Unanimous verbal approval.

TREASURER'S REPORT: $4,571.19 in the account
Boise County reimbursed us for everything submitted last time. The check for
Race to Robie Creek should come in next month.
???  Motion by John, Second by Terry--not sure what this was for???

UNIT MORALE: Billie Butler gave the Board her perceptions related to unit
morale and made some suggestions for improving it.  She volunteered to
publish a printed newsletter to summarize unit business and to have fun
stuff reported as well.  Other topics discussed related to member
recognition (including members of the earlier versions of the unit), having
food at an event quarterly, sitting in a circle at meetings, meeting at
members' homes, building rapport with the Sheriff's Department.  The next
meeting will be a potluck barbeque to be held at the Bishop's home.  If it
rains, we will move the meeting to the MCA Building.

MEMBER REQUESTS: Dennis Watkins requested a leave of absence while his
broken foot/ankle heals which was granted.  Nance Cooper's arm is still in a
sling, but it is OK for her to be on call with reduced capability as a
helper. Gus raised the question about having adult guests at the shed while
on call. A Motion--Nancy Bishop and Second--Terry Acker, was made and
approved to present an amendment of the SOP's at the next general meeting
for a vote. The change would allow one guest over the age of 18 per on call
member staying at the shed.  [Folks, the exception for day and night sounds
silly.  Yes, it's OK overnight if there is only one on-call member staying
at the shed to prevent others from feeling uncomfortable???]

EXTRICATION TRUCK: Idaho Power has donated an extrication truck that will be
operated by Wilderness Ranch Volunteer Fire Department for Mores Creek
Ambulance. The new air bags will be on it.

AED: The new AED is in. Beth will pick it up next week at the Advisory Board
meeting. There is one trainer for the three units.

SUCTION UNIT: The suction unit was not functioning well recently.
Apparently, a fitting wasn't clamped down on a hose tight enough. The
portable suction unit should be working.

FUNDRAISER MEETING: The last fundraising committee meeting was last night,
April 30. The team has serious concerns about having enough help to make the
turtle race a success. If we are going to do it we need to get started by
next week. Billie will look into insurance, and John Nesbit volunteered to
help with promotions. The yard sale is tentative.

TEAM STRUCTURE: We now have three teams composed of active members. John
Nesbit will take over leadership of Maureen's team and consult with her as
needed.

SHIRTS: We have a few polo shirts on hand, and one or two sweatshirts. John
suggested ordering Tall sizes also. Nancy will get shirt information.

LOCKING FILE CABINET: Margie had a lead on where to get a locking file
cabinet. Beth or Nancy [?] will check with her when she returns. John said
the Idaho Youth Ranch store may have something we could use also.

MEMBERSHIP STATUS: There has not been a formal process to change
probationary members to regular members. Members on the roster who are not
identified as current probationary members (newer members) should be
considered regular members because they have met the SOP requirements.
Motion to officially designate regular members--Beth Chandler, Second--Terry
Acker.  Unanimous verbal approval.

ADJOURN: 8:35 p.m.
