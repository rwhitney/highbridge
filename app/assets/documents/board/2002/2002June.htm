MORES CREEK AMBULANCE
DRAFT BOARD MEETING NOTES
JUNE 5, 2002

START:  Approximately 6:40 p.m.

BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT: Terry Acker, Nancy Bishop (via speaker phone), Beth
Chandler, Rhonda Grindstaff.

OFFICERS AND MEMBERS PRESENT: Karen Acker, Maureen Ericksen.

FUNDRAISER: The rummage sale is on. Beth will call Hilltop to confirm we can
have it there. Nancy is going to contact Idaho Youth Ranch or the ARC to
pick up the leftovers. Terry is collecting stuff at work. Ask members to
hang onto their donations if possible.  If they can't store items, let Terry
know. Maureen will create a sign up list for helpers. 

SHIFT CALENDAR: Some members still want or need phone contact. The simplest
solution seems to be having the Team Leaders contact their Team Members.
Have Tim continue sending out initial requests and sending calendar to State
Comm near the first of the month. Terry will send Team Leaders what they
need to sign up team members who don't have e-mail.

UNIFORMS: Tim Franklin had a suggestion for t-shirts for uniforms.  Beth
will get pricing information from Shadows.  Navy or khaki shorts are
acceptable as long as long pants or a jump suit are available.  Unit
t-shirts are allowed.  The key is to be professional and appropriate for the
call.  Beth will look for shirt options, preferably with a pocket to hold
stuff.  Motion: Terry,  Second: Maureen to purchase a t-shirt for each
member,   unanimous approval.

SUMMER TRAINING: A water rescue class and a scavenger hunt are being
planned.  Dates will be announced as soon as they are finalized.  Splinting
is the training topic this month, and will be taught by Jan Peterson.  Karen
has asked Mietta to provide personal disaster preparedness training in July
or August.

IN THE NEWS: Beth brought an article from a recent People magazine titled
"Snow Angels." It is about a group of at-risk young adults who formed a
rural EMT and firefighting group.  Beth and Jan talked about it a bit, and
Jan is thinking of following up with an Explorer Scouts group to see if we
could do something like that in our area.  Jan is interested in teaching an
EMT class.  Beth will ask what the County thinks at the next Advisory Board
meeting.

TEAM COMPETITION:  Maureen had an idea for a team competition.  We will
discuss options at the next general meeting.
 
LOCKING FILE CABINET:  Nancy will talk to Margie and see if she found a file
cabinet from the school district.  If not, we voted to spend the money to
buy one that will lock.  Motion: Terry, Second: Rhonda, unanimous approval.

CALL DEBRIEFING:  We had a reminder to talk to your shift team members after
each call and discuss what went right and what could be improved as part of
the quality improvement process and to facilitate better team interactions.

APPROVE MAY MINUTES:  Motion: Maureen, Second:  Terry, unanimous approval.

MEMBER STATUS:  We reviewed the membership status of a couple of members.  

UNIT MORALE:  After the events of this week, we decided we needed to keep
some structure to the unit meetings.  To build camaraderie and still have
professional, efficient meetings, we decided to have food and a social hour
prior to the meetings to give unit members a chance to visit.  Remind
everyone to help pick up the shed, or whatever location we use.  Nancy will
check with Bill on options for a shorter form of the leadership training the
unit did a few years ago. Investigate other ideas for team building,
possibly something like milk carton raft races.

RESIGNATIONS:  Beth was able to communicate with John Nesbit and got a list
of issues from him.  One issue in the past was not knowing where the
ambulance was.  We would prefer to have crews who take it home return it
before the next shift.  We have some members who are strapped financially or
for time.  One option to help them would be to stock some staple items for
eating at the shed.  See if local area members would adopt a person for part
of a shift.  Check with satellite TV providers and video stores to see if
the unit could get discounts.  Motion to buy groceries: Nancy, Second:
Terry, unanimous approval.  Beth and Terry will stock up on stuff at Costco.
See if we can find half lockers to put in the bedroom to stow personal
items.  Terry will try the Idaho Youth Ranch.  Motion to buy wood, hardware,
marine varnish for picnic tables, propane tank and adapter for the barbeque
grill: Beth, Second: Maureen, unanimous approval.  We will discuss these
solutions at the next general meeting and see if there are other ideas for
how to deal with morale.  We tentatively scheduled an awards banquet on
September 21, 2002. Spouses are invited.  Ask members to buy their own
beverages,  the unit will fund the dinner.  Maureen will check with Louie's
on the availability of a group dining room.

ADJOURN:  8:31 p.m.  Motion: Beth, Second: Terry, unanimous approval.
