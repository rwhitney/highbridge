MORES CREEK AMBULANCE BOARD MEETING MINUTES
APRIL 4, 2002

Board Members Present:  Terry Acker, Nancy Bishop, Beth Chandler, Rhonda
Grindstaff
Officers Present:  Karen Acker, Renee Johanson

START: 6:48 p.m.

*	DISCUSS TEAMS: Discussed changing to three teams instead of four
teams. The number of active members seems to fit better. Maureen might like
to be relieved of Team Lead responsibilities. Send out an e-mail message to
ask for volunteers. Suggestion was made to ask John Nesbit if he would be
willing to take on the Team Leader role. Meeting attendance may be an issue
for him during the next few months, but we could have him call and
participate via speaker phone.
*	BOARD MEETING SCHEDULE: Change back to meeting on the first
Wednesday of the month, because the first Thursday conflicts with the East
Boise County Ambulance Advisory Board meeting.
*	RACE TO ROBIE CREEK: We will have the on-call team (Jan, Gus, John)
with the ambulance at the finish line. Six others have volunteered to help
at other stations along the race course. ATV's have been lined up and have
crews. Need to figure out where to station them. Considering the summit,
Reiniger's, Robie Creek Fire Station.
*	ROBIE CREEK TRAINING FIRE: This will take place on April 6. Page for
Robie Creek to go out at 7:30 a.m. Ambulance to get paged out at 8:00 a.m.
The live fire will be at 2:00.  Estimated 8 or 9 firefighters from Robie
Creek, 6 or 7 from Wilderness Ranch. The Governor and local press entourage
is expected to be on scene.  Terry thinks Dave from Robie Creek is taking
care of food. Folks will ask around to see if someone has an awning to use.
*	FUNDRAISING OPPORTUNITY: The rubber duck race is being reinstated
for the River Fest. We are still going to pursue having a duck race for a
fund raiser. Considering starting the race at Grimes Creek/Clear Creek.
Virginia is checking on insurance. Karen talked to the Corps of Engineers
about filling out an application, including the number of expected
attendees. Idaho has a statute for rubber duck races. The next phase is to
talk to Dave Haney and Rob from Clear Creek and see if they want to
participate.
*	CPR CLASS: The next CPR class is planned for May 13 or 15. Doug
Trosky talked to Karen about the unit purchasing a few of the books to have
on hand. Motion to purchase a few books: Beth. Second: Nancy. Unanimous
approval.
*	MAPPING DEMO: The GIS demonstration will be April 18 or 19. April 18
is our next meeting and AED training.
*	SAR RADIO DONATIONS: Search and Rescue donated 10 Motorola hand held
radios. They are programmed with F2/State Comm and Boise County Fire 1. We
need a few batteries and chargers. Order half of the batteries and a couple
of chargers later, e.g., May.
*	TREASURER'S BUSINESS:  The following items were discussed briefly:
check for Beth; ITB grant report to be done;  background check information
needs to be filed for everyone; Rimview Road Association dues $130 bill
(goes to County for payment), Nancy brought back some shields from an EMS
conference in Pocatello--ok to reimburse for 4 of them to go in the Rewards
basket; AED information packet passed around; Rhonda will get information
from Treasea and Karen for the AED grant application
