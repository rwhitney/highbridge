<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AMBULANCE STATUS – Terry reported that the service engine light is on &amp; we’re still having problems with 4H.  Dirk will have two new snow tires installed on the front wheels tomorrow.  He also discussed the ambulance radio—it’s out for bid &amp; will probably go to Mountain West.  He’s recommending a Kenwood TK90, which is 100 watts, with 2 independent units—one in the front of the ambulance &amp; an independent one in back.  $1600 was approved in the County’s budget for this purchase.  Additionally, the chip for increased performance should be available in the next week.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>EBCA SOP’s – Treasea is reviewing other State units’ SOP’s to consolidate a proposed draft to present to the Advisory Board for review.  In the interim, we use our SOP’s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OLD BUSINESS</B>:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TEAM CONTEST – The winner of the contest is &quot;Team Acker&quot;.  It was decided that the celebration dinner will be January 12, 2002.  The Team Leaders will get together to decide the team responsibilities for the dinner, menu, etc.  At the December regular Member Meeting (Dec. 18), we will have a potluck &amp; gift exchange ($5 or less) &amp; no training.  The Team Leaders will also discuss the realignment of teams (or not) for next year.  Each Team will elect its Leader.  Bob Murnighan will be on Maureen’s team.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW MEMBER INTERVIEWS – Beth is planning to schedule an interview with Angela Aldrich &amp; Holly Green for next Thursday, Nov. 15.  Terry &amp; John mentioned that they would be available.  Dirk suggested contacting them to see if they would be available to meet at 8:00 a.m.,  Nov. 17<SUP>th</SUP>, prior to Hal’s Terrorist Training class.  Beth will let everyone know.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ELECTION REPORT – Carol distributed a sample ballot for the Nov. 20 elections.

Carol will e-mail all members so that they’re aware that absentee ballots are available for any member unable to attend the Nov. 20 meeting.  Additionally, Karen mentioned that brand new members (3 months or less) are not able to vote.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW BUSINESS</B>:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MENTORING – Karen suggested an additional step between the interview process and driver training, since there are so many questions being asked during driver training about unrelated topics.  She is suggesting a meeting between the new member &amp; their Team Leader to review the Handbook/SOP’s &amp; By-Laws, use of the radio, calendar, shots, etc.  Additionally, the Team Leader can delegate this responsibility among his/her team members.  The Team Leaders will also discuss this during their meeting on the January dinner.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">COMMUNICATIONS --- Margie suggested that the budget needs to be e-mailed to members, so they know what funds are available to our unit.  Additionally, we need more information coming out of the Advisory Board meetings and a monthly budget from the Treasurer distributed to the membership.  This information can be posted on the website.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WINTER SEASON – Beth discussed the need to be prepared in the event of a snowmobile accident, Christmas tree outing, hunting accident, etc., where we might have to pack in to a patient.  She’s hoping to set up a training class with Search &amp; Rescue---surviving the elements.  Dirk suggested we put together a survival kit for the ambulance (similar to the one Beth brought to the meeting) that would include protective gear, fuel to start fires, food, shelter, maps, etc.  Terry mentioned that we need to be careful in the ambulance with fuel sources, considering that we carry oxygen.  Dirk made a motion &amp; Terry seconded the motion to put this emergency kit together.  Karen will work with Aimee Hastriter for this training next year.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ROPES TRAINING – Beth questioned whether we want to invest in the equipment we’d need in the ambulance for ropes rescue---harness, ropes, carabiners, etc. (approx. $200-$300).  Margie mentioned that there is $500 in the County’s budget for extrication &amp; an additional $2,000 for MCA to purchase a new AED.  It was decided that we’ll hold off for now on these equipment purchases.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DRIVER’S TRAINING ISSUES --- Mietta requested a discussion of those individuals who are authorized to perform driver training.  After much discussion, it was determined that Kim is to decide who should be on the Driver Training Team &amp; she should coordinate appropriate training.  It was the Board’s understanding that Kim’s Driver Training Team consisted of Kim, John, Terry &amp; Karen.  Mietta needs to be added to this list &amp; to the link on the website.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HAZMAT CLASS – Tentatively scheduled for January 26, 2002.  Margie will contact Hal about this date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GOOD OF THE ORDER</B>:  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BETH’S SCHEDULE – Beth mentioned that she will be working part-time during the holidays at Williams-Sonoma &amp; will be very busy on the weekends.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THANKSGIVING WEEKEND --- Mietta is on the schedule throughout the Thanksgiving weekend.  As the SOP’s state, &quot;. . .it is recommended that a member take no more than 4 consecutive 12-hour shifts back-to-back&quot;.  The Board reiterated this recommendation and suggested that Mietta arrange for back-up in the event she receives several calls in a short time period.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There being no further business, Carol made a motion &amp; Beth seconded the motion to adjourn the meeting at 8:30 p.m.</P>
