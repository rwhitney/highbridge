<FONT SIZE=2><P>MORES CREEK AMBULANCE EXECUTIVE BOARD MEETING</P>
<P>October 2, 2001</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beth Chandler called the Regular Board Meeting of Mores Creek Ambulance Executive Board to order at 6:40 p.m. The meeting was held at the MCA Building.  Officers present: Beth Chandler, President; Dirk Myers, Vice President and EBCA Advisory Board; and Carol Riazzi, Secretary/Treasurer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Team Leaders present: Margie Jones, Maureen Ericksen, John McCarthy &amp; Terry Acker.  Member present:  Karen Acker. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MEMBER RESIGNATION – Beth Gorringe has resigned due to personal reasons.  Dirk suggested that we ask her if she wants to take a 6 month leave of absence.  This now leaves only 2 members on the Fund Raising Committee &amp; a vacancy in the Supply Officer position.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FUND RAISING COMMITTEE --- Maureen reported that there are now 3 raffle prizes---First prize is the 2 Southwest Airlines tickets; Second prize is a Snicklefritz Party (Value of $75); and Third Prize is an assortment of restaurant coupons (Value of $30).  Beth discussed making our goal for the fundraiser a Stryker Rugged Gurney.  It was also suggested that we park the ambulance at various subdivisions (possibly Clear Creek Lodge &amp; The Rocks, too) and sell tickets.  Beth also suggested that in the future we will attempt to coordinate large scale fundraising efforts with the 2 Fire Departments.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SCHEDULE – Beve is getting overwhelmed.  Terry mentioned that the on-line calendar will hopefully be available within the next few weeks, which will help alleviate some of Beve’s frustration.  However, someone still needs to monitor the schedule &amp; prompt the members (Terry suggested that Team Leaders continue to do the &quot;prompting&quot;).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NON-PARTICIPATING MEMBERS – Beth prepared a letter to be sent to these members, letting them know that we need to clean up the roster in order to know who really wants to be involved.  We’re specifically asking for a response from them in writing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW EQUIPMENT – Beth purchased bolt cutters, winter wheel chocks, tow rope &amp; a come-along for the ambulance.  Margie suggested some training on this new equipment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW APPLICANTS—We have two new applicant interviews scheduled for Thursday evening:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Tiffany Brown @ 6:15 p.m.—Currently taking EMT class</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Reggie Boyle @ 7:00 p.m. – Registered nurse who wants to take EMT class</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EDUCATIONAL TRAINING REIMBURSEMENT – It was decided we definitely need a policy on educational training reimbursement.  All requests for reimibursement should be approved by the Board.  Terry made a motion and Dirk seconded the motion that &quot;All new members will receive training reimbursement in the amount of $50 for the first year of their MCA membership, with discretionary Board approval on additional amounts&quot;.  It was noted that Boise County reduced the training reimbursement next year to:  $150 for EMT’s and $75 for drivers. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FALL EMT CLASS – The grant approved $3,840, along with criminal history checks in the amount of $260.  There is also $5,000 in the county budget, which will just about give us enough, as long as Jan agrees to be the instructor.  Margie agareed to continue to work on the arrangements, as long as the class is held at our building.  Dirk will find out more at the Advisory Board Meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOMINATING COMMITTEE –The Committee is meeting tomorrow (October 3) at Margie’s to compile a slate of candidates. These candidates will be contacted to determine if they are interested in running for an officer’s position &amp; the slate of candidates will be presented at the October 16 member meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TEAM STANDINGS –Needs to be worked out by the Team Leaders.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LIFE FLIGHT LANDING ZONE – Beth is meeting with Dr. Burkholder (sp) at 10:30 a.m. on Friday.  If he gives us permission, Sunday will be the work day.  Beth will send out an e-mail on this.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ROSTER—Dirk once again is asking the Team Leaders to help get the EMT certification numbers &amp; dates, CPR information &amp; License #’s that are missing from the Certification Sheet.</P>
