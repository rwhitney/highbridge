<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TEAM CONTEST – Maureen made a proposal that the pressure of this contest should be on the members, not on the Team Leaders.  She recommended that we send letters to the EMT’s who are not taking the required number of shifts, along with a calendar &amp; a copy of the contract they signed with the County, telling them that they need to take the minimum number of shifts, or be billed for the class.  We need to focus our energies on those members who want to participate.  Margie mentioned that those prospective-EMT’s who did not pass, have 2 years to pass the test before they can be billed.  The Education Reimbursement issue was also discussed---$50 for the first year and $100 once that first year is completed---needs to be in the SOP’s.  Margie will get copies of the commitment letters.  Dirk will update the shift/member list &amp; forward to Margie.  It was decided that this contest is intended to be a unity builder---something to get the teams together.  It was also suggested that we blend the &quot;losers&quot; together as the second, third &amp; fourth place teams.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MANDATORY TRAINING – Dirk suggested a mandatory training meeting sometime in the near future, that requires attendance by all EMT’s, or the submission of a written notice to the Board 2 weeks prior to the date of the mandatory training if they can’t attend.  It was decided that this should be the Hazmat training.  Margie will check to see if the Hazmat instructor is available in mid-November.  We may possibly skip the general member meeting and have the officer election at the 8-hour Hazmat training.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRAINING – Karen updated the Board on Kim’s schedule of upcoming training (Kim will be sending out an e-mail to all members):</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MISCELLANEOUS—</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Discussion of partial shift coverage &amp; the Board’s expectations---an attempt  needs to be made to fill the full 12-hour shift, by the person covering the portion of the shift (same expectation exists when a crewmember needs to leave early from a shift---it is their responsibility to find someone to fill in for them &amp; inform the rest of the crew)</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Personnel Files  -- Karen asked if a member can see their own personnel file.  Beth responded &quot;yes&quot;, but only their own personnel file, no other members’ file.</LI></P></UL>
