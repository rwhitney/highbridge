<ol>
	<li>General Standards of Conduct</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Teamwork -- Although volunteers, we will conduct ourselves as professionals and we will work as a team.</li>

		<li>Priorities -- Our top priority when responding to emergencies is our safety and the safety of fellow emergency workers. Our next priority is quality patient care.</li>

		<li>Code of Ethics -- Our EMT's will abide by the "EMT Code of Ethics" adopted by the National Association of EMT's.</li>

		<li>Privacy -- We will respect our patients' privacy, keeping details of calls for in-house discussion and training only. Publicly, we will give only general descriptions.</li>

		<li>Criticism -- Gossiping and criticizing others behind their back will eventually demoralize the entire team. If we cannot say something directly to the person involved, no one else needs to hear about it either.</li>

		<li>Learning from our Mistakes -- All responders must participate in a systematic critique immediately after each call. If there is a disagreement on the action taken, now is the time to get it out in the open, so that everyone involved can discuss the problem and learn from it. Unless otherwise agreed, the end of each critique "closes the book". (See SOP 3: Critiques)</li>

		<li>On-Call Duty -- EMT's and drivers are expected to serve the minimum amount of shifts as outlined in 2.7, and are encouraged to serve as many shifts beyond the minimum as their personal and professional commitments will allow. The team depends on everyone on call to be enroute within 15 minutes of tone-out. Members who cannot make a shift are responsible for finding a replacement.</li>

		<li>Medical Knowledge and Skills -- EMTâ€™s must keep up-to-date on medical knowledge and skills. Mores Creek Ambulance through their Training Officer(s) will schedule training events. EMT's must keep their certifications up to date and are required by National registry (every two years) to have done the following: 24 hours of refresher course; 48 hours of CE's; verification of skill maintenance and to have a current affidavit of CPR proficiency.</li>

		<li>Caring for Equipment -- We depend on our equipment being ready-to-go at all times. If anything is broken, not in it's assigned slot in the ambulance, being cleaned, or missing, the person who last used it is responsible for notifying the following shifts and for arranging to get it back in service. Equipment is for Mores Creek Ambulance use only.</li>

		<li>We are Non-Profit &amp; Non-Commercial -- Members shall not accept personal payments or gifts in exchange for emergency medical or similar services. However; we can accept donations and gifts on behalf of the organization; such generosity shall be acknowledged and publicized promptly.</li>

		<li>Members shall neither endorse nor appear to endorse any commercial product or service unless approved in writing, in advance by the executive board.</li>

		<li>Members should consult the executive board in advance when a personal enterprise might conflict or appear to conflict with these policies.</li>

		<li>Speaking for Mores Creek Ambulance -- By actions and words, all members do, in effect, represent Mores Creek Ambulance. This is true whether we are in uniform or civvies, whether on-call or off-duty, since we live in small, close-knit communities.<br /><br />

			Members must therefore be careful to distinguish between their own opinions and the consensus of the team. The President is our official spokesperson, and the Advisory Board member from Mores Creek Ambulance, represents us on the Advisory Board.</li>

		<li>Spirit of Standard Operating Procedures -- The executive board is responsible for monitoring and enforcing these standards of conduct. All members are responsible for abiding by the spirit of these standards.</li>

		<li>Use of Tobacco -- The use of tobacco in any form â€“ cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco or snuff â€“ will not be permitted when interacting with the public. This restriction is effective from the time any member responds to a call, arrives on scene, to the time the patient(s) have been released or turned over to a higher authority and/or the ambulance has departed the scene or hospital. Tobacco use is not allowed in any emergency vehicles, ambulance and/or extrication vehicle or the MCA building.</li>

		<li>Alcohol and Drug Policy -- Members are prohibited from taking call while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. Responding to a call while under the influence of any substance that impairs decision-making or alters or compromises the safety of the crew and patient is prohibited.</li>
	</ol>

	<li>Membership</li>

	<ol>
		<li>Who Can Join -- Membership in Mores Creek Ambulance shall be open to Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTâ€™s) certified by the State of Idaho, and to other individuals who contribute to the purpose of the organization.</li>

		<li>Physical Fitness -- Members must be physically able to perform emergency medical services work. The executive board may make exceptions for â€œnon-callâ€ volunteers (mechanics, bookkeepers, etc.) whose contributions to the organization do not involve being on-call.</li>

		<li>Taking the Initiative -- We want motivated members who can take charge of situations. Accordingly, applicants and members are expected to initiate their own applications, training, and status upgrades.</li>

		<li>Applying for Membership<br /><br />

			Step 1. Complete Application Form. Applicants must submit written applications documenting their qualifications and intent to abide by Mores Creek Ambulance Bylaws, SOPâ€™s and Idaho Emergency Medical Service protocols.<br /><br />

			Step 2. Evaluation of Application. The executive board, or committee designated by it, shall verify and consider each applicant using the following selection criteria:<br /><br />

			<ul>
				<li>Driving record check</li>
				<li>EMS certification verified through Idaho State EMS Bureau</li>
				<li>Experience</li>
				<li>Emotional maturity</li>
				<li>Information and impressions gained from an interview with the applicant</li>
				<li>Any other factors it deems important for making its decision.</li>
			</ul><br />

			Factors specifically excluded are: race, sex, religion, age, or national origin.<br /><br />
			
			Step 3. Notification of Selection.<br /><br />

			<ul>
				<li>Applicants selected will be notified to sign up for an orientation and drivers training.</li>
				<li>Applicants not selected will be notified in writing (or email). The board, at its discretion, may suggest that the applicant reapply after some future date.</li>
			</ul><br />

			Step 4. Vehicle Operations. The purpose of this application step is to provide prospective members with a hands-on overview of how we operate before they assist on actual calls.<br /><br />

			Topics covered will include safety, communications, equipment layout, confidentiality, and basic driving skills.<br /><br />

			For optimum hands-on learning, we will orient no more than two applicants at a time. Applicants must drive our vehicle(s).<br /><br />

			We also use the orientation and test ride to screen applicants who display immaturity, unsafe driving, or behavior that would hinder teamwork. Concern about the suitability of any applicant during this step must be forwarded to the board.<br /><br />

			Step 5. Pass/Fail Vehicle Operations.<br /><br />
			
			<ul>
				<li>Applicants who successfully complete the Vehicle Operations step become probationary members, and are eligible to ride as observers and helpers with experienced members. New probationary members must then come to the next general meeting, where they will be introduced to the general membership, given Bylaws/SOP packet, and assigned a portable number. The intent is to have probationary and experienced members meet in a relaxed setting so that they do not meet for the first time on call.</li>
				<li>Applicants who fail vehicle orientation and test ride. Refer to section 2.4, step 3B.</li>
			</ul><br />
		</li>
		
		<li>Probationary Membership - Probationary members have all rights and responsibilities of regular members, except that they:<br /><br />
		
		<ul>
			<li>Can take call duty only if accompanied by a regular member.</li>
			<li>Must have regular members fill out a â€˜probationary member evaluationâ€™ when they have a call.</li>
			<li>Cannot be an MCA officer or vote in an election of officers.</li>
			<li>Cannot participate in a vote to dissolve the group. (They can vote on other issues.)</li>
		</ul><br />

		Probationary members are expected to participate in the working of the organization, as well as taking call.
		</li>

		<li>Upgrading to Regular Membership â€“ Having successfully participated in three patient contact calls or being current active status and having served 20 shifts (non-call volunteers having served for six months), a probationary member will automatically become a regular member, unless the board has been notified in writing of concerns by regular members. The board makes the final decision by a majority vote.</li>

		<li>Membership Categories</li>
	
		<ol>
			<li>Active - An EMT or driver must work a minimum of forty-eight (48) hours every two months, and attend at least one meeting or training session every three months. Active members are expected to attend any meeting listed as "mandatory". Non-call members should contribute a comparable amount of time, and attend at least one meeting every three months and keep current with training skills. Active members are eligible for educational reimbursement, the amount to be set on an annual basis by EBCA.</li>

			<li>Reduced-duty Membership - Local members (for a maximum of six months) whose work, travel, school, or other obligations prevent them from maintaining active membership can apply to the executive board in writing for reduced duty. Reduced-duty members must attend at least two general membership meetings every six months and attend any mandatory meetings. Such members, volunteer when they can, but must:</li>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Work a minimum of 48 hours every six months;</li>
				<li>Keep current on MCA issues;</li>
				<li>Maintain their certifications and skills; and</li>
				<li>Maintain training</li>
				<li>Probationary, reduced duty and inactive members are not eligible for educational reimbursement</li>
			</ul>

			<li>Associate - Member who has a primary membership with another unit but desires to help once in a while. Must maintain their training and skills with their primary unit and periodically furnish MCA information of their current abilities and experience. Must attend two meetings every six months.</li>

			<li>Leave of Absence - Members may, once every two years, request a leave of absence with the board's approval for a period not to exceed six months. Upon returning from leave, such members must attend one general meeting before regaining their right to vote.</li>

			<li>Medical Release - Health, pregnancy etc. Need to fill out a leave form.</li>
		</ol>

		<li>Inactive Members - Any member who has not attended a meeting for three months or who remains inactive for more than three months or has not fulfilled the required amount of shift will be assumed to have resigned and will be terminated by the executive board with appropriate notification.</li>

		<li>Disciplinary Actions - The executive board shall handle grievances, disciplinary actions, and terminations according to the Bylaws.</li>

		<li>Personnel Files - Personnel files are confidential. MCA may release information from member's file to others only if the member authorizes such release, or by court subpoena.</li>

		<li>All applications and notes become part of a personnel record, which remains the property of MCA. Personnel files of all members and applicants shall be kept by MCA in a safe place for five years and then be destroyed.</li>
	</ol>
</ol>

3. Critiques

3.1         Purpose of Critiques â€“ We do critiques to improve the quality and efficiency of our patient care and to point out unsafe situations to be avoided in the future.

When to Critique â€“ Immediately after each call, before the details are forgotten.

Who Needs Them? â€“ All MCA members involved in a call must complete a critique together. Non-MCA responders may also be included in the critique if all MCA responders agree to this.

Face-to-Face â€“ People not connected with the call should not be present. There should be no other distractions.

3.2         The First Question â€“ The critique leader (any willing crewmember) verifies that everyone is settled, and then asks this open-ended question: â€œHow do you all feel about this call?â€ One by one, people respond if they wish. On this first round, no one should interrupt or attempt to defend any concern raised. The objective is to get all issues out in the open.

Keeping the Critique Constructive â€“ The critique leader then asks more detailed questions to focus the discussion. He or she makes sure everyone is heard, one at a time. One technique is to â€œwalk-throughâ€ the incident chronologically, asking for comments about dispatch, response, at scene, transport, at the hospital, etc.

Keeping it Timely â€“ The critique leader must balance the need to get all details hashed out versus available time. Most critiques take less than 20 minutes. If circumstances (like a second call) prevent an immediate critique â€“ or if those involved want to continue a complex critique at some other time â€“ all should agree on a date and time right away.

Critique-Leader can participate too â€“ The critique leader may make comments too, but only after saying: â€œStepping out of the critique-leader role, I think thatâ€¦.â€

Listen First, Then Answer â€“ When receiving criticism, listen to the entire statement(s) before responding.

Praise Good Jobs â€“ Feel free to praise someone for a good performance. Donâ€™t overlook someone's positive actions.

3.3         The Last Question â€“ When the critique has covered all points, the critique-leader verifies this by asking: â€œDoes anyone have anything else to say about this call?â€

3.4         Closing the Book â€“ Once finished, a critique closes the book on a call â€“ unless a participant says right then and there that he or she will take a particular serious concern to the Executive Board. All members are required to report substandard performance of any other member. Unless reported otherwise, new membersâ€™ performance will be assumed to be satisfactory.

4. PATIENT CARE Reports and Paperwork



4.1         Patient Care Report (PCR or Run Sheet) -- A PCR is to be completed for every patient on every call, including fire standby, and even if the patient refuses treatment or transport. The PCR should be completed by the Lead EMT, or any other crewmember designated by the Lead EMT (e.g., if the driver is not involved with traffic control or equipment retrieval, he/she may gather the information from the patient to be placed on the PCR). The patient, or Responsible Party for the patient, should sign & date the "Receipt of Services" section, and the "Refusal of Treatment/Transport" section, if applicable. The hospital representative receiving the patient should sign & date the "Signature of Person Receiving Patient" section. The entire crew should also sign & date the PCR in the "Crew Signatures" section. Leave the third copy at the hospital desk and place the original in the hanging file folder in the ambulance bay for forwarding to Boise County by the Secretary/Treasurer or deposit the entire form in the bin at the shed for distribution to the county. St. Luke's and St. Al's will provide a copy of the patient's admittance sheet, if requested. This sheet will usually include the patient's name, address, phone, employer, insurance coverage, etc. This sheet should be attached to MCA's copy of the PCR.



4.2         Mileage Log -- The date, beginning and ending mileage, description of call (e.g., MVA on Hwy. 21, mile marker 26), and initials of the driver should be listed in the Mileage Log at the end of every call. In addition, if the ambulance is moved for training, maintenance, refueling, etc., the mileage log should be completed for that event.



4.3         Supply Log -- Note in this log all supplies used during a call (this information is also listed on the PCR). Replace items used, or call the Supply & Equipment Officer if available supplies are depleted.



4.4         Meal Receipts -- Boise County allows $8/crewmember for a quick meal (to go preferably) or beverage on transports only. Use the petty cash money located in the Mileage Log book & place the receipt, listing the names & portable numbers of all crewmembers and the PCR Report # on the receipt, in the cash envelope.


5. Mores Creek Ambulance Response Area

5.1         Response Area -- That section of East Boise County Ambulance District, south of milepost 29 on highway 21 up to the Ada County line, the areas East and West of this section of highway 21, including Grimes Creek, up to the wooden bridge, and Clear Creek; Daggett Creek, Wilderness Ranch, Spring Shores Marina, and the Arrow Rock reservoir to Cottonwood Creek Ranger Station. In the wintertime, coverage on this road is all the way to Atlanta. MCA will not respond to calls outside of itâ€™s response area unless:

Â·   Directed by State Communication

Â·   Specifically requested by another unit



5.2 First Response â€“ EMTâ€™s associated with MCA, who because of the geographical location of their residence, or who happen to be close to the area of the call, and therefore are in a position to arrive at the scene of the call ahead of the ambulance, can act as First Responders. In that capacity, they will provide patient care until the ambulance arrives. At that time they will update the ambulance team on all conditions of the patient and care provided up to that point and offer to turn patient management over to the ambulance crew assigned to the shift/geographical area. If you are not a scheduled crewmember, under NO circumstances should the ambulance be removed from the building without prior communication and permission from the Lead EMT on shift.


6. Radio Procedures

6.1         Ambulance Radios â€“ Ambulance radios are for official use only.

6.2               Listen before you transmit â€“ If you hear other radio traffic, get a sense of how important it is before you interrupt. Remember that State Communication covers the entire state of Idaho, mostly through repeaters you cannot hear. When State Communication says, â€œStandbyâ€, please comply.

6.3               On the Air â€“ Plan what you are going to say before going on the air. To allow other radios time to lock onto your transmission, wait one breath after keying the mike (i.e. pressing the transmit button) before actually speaking. Keep the mike keyed until after you stop talking â€“ sounds obvious, but many people cut themselves off.

6.4 Medical Jargon/Techno Babble â€“ Keep transmissions concise. To that end, avoid jargon, ten-codes, or Buck Rogers style transmissions. Plain English is the language of choice.

Incorrect: â€œIdaho State Communications Center, this is Mores Creek Ambulance. We are now enroute from our subdivision at this time. Be advised that our Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) to the motor vehicle accident scene at Milepost 24 on highway 21 is approximately 5 minutes. Could you please tell us if Idaho State Police or Boise County Sheriffâ€™s Office are on location yet?â€

Correct: â€œState Comm, Mores Creek Ambulance now leaving for highway 21, milepost 24, ETA 5 minutes. Is law enforcement on scene?â€

6.5               Professionalism â€“ Professionals maintain their cool on the radio. If within earshot of boisterous discussions or a screaming patient, step aside before keying the mike.

6.6               Care of Radios -- Users are responsible for keeping the radios operational, ready to go at all times. Like muscles and brains, rechargeable batteries must be â€œexercisedâ€. Letting a radio (battery) languish in the charger lowers the batteryâ€™s capacity to hold a charge. When fully charged, take the radio (or battery only) out. Each radio should have two batteries. Keep the extra one fully charged. Make it a habit to use a fresh battery daily â€“ to prevent â€œdeadâ€ radios. A flashing yellow light means a low battery on the King radio; be sure to turn the radio off when changing the battery.

6.7               Radio Frequencies â€“ State Comm. F2 is our main EMS channel, used for almost all of our communications. Most radios also have Boise County Sheriff Dispatch, Boise County Fire, Weather Service, and Hospital frequencies. Actual channel numbers vary depending on the type of radio you are issued. When you are finished using other frequencies, always turn your radio back to the channel for State Comm.

6.8               Knobs and Dials â€“ Learn the controls of your radio before you take it on duty. Borrow a user manual or ask a current member for instructions if necessary.

6.9               How to sleep while on call â€“ Set your radio to your Encode Mode/Nightmode, so that it will be silent until State Comm calls MCA. The radio will still be listening, but only for the MCA tone. While Horseshoe Bend might be called out, your radio will not go off unless it is a call for MCA. When an encoded radio senses our unique signal from State Comm, it generates itâ€™s own sound and turns on the speaker. Set the volume control at maximum when encoding, so that you will hear that squeal.

6.10            Pager Tests â€“ Pager tests are completed weekly (usually Friday evenings at 7 p.m.). Your radio tone will go off and State Comm will say, â€œMores Creek Ambulance, pager test, pager test only, any portables acknowledge?â€ We respond using our portable numbers. For example, â€œPortable 3 loud and clearâ€, or â€œPortable 8 copies, but you are broken.â€ And so on. If State Comm does not acknowledge your response, wait a few seconds and try again, or landline State Comm at the number listed on the current roster.



7. On-Call Scheduling

7.1               Schedules â€“ MCAâ€™s goal is to have two EMTâ€™s and a driver for every scheduled shift, with every member serving their fair share of on-call duty.

7.2 Scheduler(s) â€“ Members are encouraged to volunteer to serve as scheduler(s) at some point in their membership. The scheduler(s) will be responsible for maintaining the schedule.

7.3 Preparing the Schedule â€“ Each member will be contacted to sign up for duty by the scheduler several weeks prior to the schedule period. The schedule is on the website and members shall sign themselves up for shifts or contact the scheduler to sign up for shifts. The ultimate responsibility to sign up for duty lies with the member. The schedule must be distributed no later than three days prior to its effective date. One copy to be sent to State Communications and one to EBCA.

7.4               Lead EMT's â€“ A Lead EMT will be designated for each shift having more than one EMT. In case a newer EMT has not had his three calls in, the senior EMT will be the Lead EMT. The Lead EMT is responsible for communicating with State Comm prior to the beginning of the shift to verify that MCA is "in service". All team members are responsible for contacting each other prior to the beginning of each shift to make sure they are on duty, ready to respond and to arrange rendezvous locations, if necessary. If the Lead EMT has not contacted you, you contact them.

7.5               Member Unable to cover Shift Assignment â€“ It is the memberâ€™s responsibility to find a replacement to take their place in the event they are unable to cover their shift assignment. This member should contact (by phone) the other crewmembers on call and inform them of his/her replacement.

7.6               Consecutive shifts --- In order to reduce the amount of burnout in members and to assure alert, rested EMT's and drivers, a member may take no more than 4 consecutive 12-hour shifts back-to-back.

7.7               Service area â€“ members on call must remain in service area throughout their shift unless necessary for fuel or other required supplies. If a member must leave the service area, they must communicate this to State Comm.

7.8               On-Call Duty â€“ A member may not be on call with MCA while they are on-call with work.




8. UNIFORM, ATTIRE and APPEARANCE

8.1               Members are encouraged to maintain a professional appearance any time they are on call. This helps foster patient and public confidence in the unit and the individual. It also assists in distinguishing EMS personnel from bystanders and victims. Responding personnel must be wearing an approved MCA shirt or blouse. Approved shirts or blouses will be a uniform style button down or collared â€œpoloâ€ style shirt in navy blue or jade. Pants will be dark colored work or uniform style trousers, though clean denim jeans are acceptable. Navy blue MCA jumpsuits may also be worn. Hats are approved when featuring the MCA logo or other dark colored hat featuring EMS related decoration or insignia (i.e., St Luke's, Lifeflight, Star of Life, etc.) Because of safety and health-related issues, shorts and skirts are not approved attire for personnel responding to a call.

8.2               Jumpsuits may also be issued to individual members, depending on availability. Jumpsuits may be available at the ambulance building for â€œcommunityâ€ use by all responding personnel. Additional shirts and uniform items may be distributed over time, as funds are available.

8.3               Since our logo represents a visual image of MCA, we restrict its use to assure that the image our members present is aligned with our core value of "professionalism". Any use of the logo on personal items must be approved by the Uniform Code Committee prior to having it applied by Shadows.

8.4               Members will maintain their uniform in a clean, tear and stain free condition.

8.5               The following patches, badges, pins and insignias are approved for inclusion on an MCA shirt, blouse, jumpsuit, hat or coat. Deviation from this list requires prior written consent of the Executive Board

Â·     Idaho state EMT shoulder patch

Â·     NREMT shoulder patch

Â·     East Boise County ambulance patch

Â·     A name plate or badge

Â·     American flag patch, badge or pin

Â·     EMT or EMS oriented pins (â€œEMTâ€, Lifeflight, St ALâ€™s or St Luke's pins)

Â·     EMS related insignias or markers designed to be safety reflective.



8.6 Shoes -- A hard sole safety or work shoe/boot is recommended but not required. Weather and surface conditions should be considered when selecting a shoe for responding to a call.


9. Vehicle Maintenance

9.1               External Electrical Hook-up of Ambulance â€“ Any time the ambulance is parked in the ambulance building, the driver shall make sure that the battery switch is turned off in the vehicle and that it is connected to an external 120-volt source. This will keep the main batteries charged.

9.2 Fueling â€“ Since there are no diesel stations in our operating area, both tanks must be filled every time the ambulance is in Boise. In case of an emergency, use the two fuel containers in the back of the ambulance building. Information regarding fuel cards is provided in the pocket above the driverâ€™s side visor.

9.3               Vehicle Maintenance â€“ The inspections listed below shall be performed by the Vehicle Maintenance Officer, at a frequency of no less than once a month. A record of the inspections shall be maintained and kept in the ambulance.

Â·               Check fluid level:

Engine oil*

Transmission oil

Power steering fluid

Battery fluid

Windshield washer fluid

Â·               Belts

Â·               Windshield wipers

Â·               Lights (interior & exterior)

Â·               Tire pressure

Â·               Snow tires (as required by weather conditions)



* Oil changes shall be performed every three months or every 3,000 miles (whichever comes first). Please obtain an extra copy of the service checklist for Mores Creek Ambulance records. All billing statements should be forwarded to EBCA in Idaho City.






10. SUPPLIES & EQUIPMENT

10.1 Maintenance of Battery-Powered Equipment â€“ The following maintenance shall be performed by the Supplies & Equipment Officer:



Batteries shall be charged at the frequencies listed below:

Â·   Laerdal Heartbeat 3000 Defibrillator (3 batteries) - changed once a month

Â·   Automatic Suction 003030 - charged once a month

Â·   Auto BP Monitor Mate 9000 - leave plugged in

Â·   Flashlight (inside patient compartment) - leave plugged in



Batteries of the following items shall be checked at the frequency specified:

Â·   GPS - check battery once a month

Â·   Strobe lights - check battery once a month

Â·   Thermometer Thermoscan HM-2 - check battery once a month

Â·   Flashlight (behind driver seat) - check battery once a month





All batteries, necessary chargers and plug-in cords need to be kept in the ambulance building.

A maintenance record shall be maintained and kept in the ambulance building.

All instruction manuals and instruction material for all equipment should be kept in the ambulance.

A supply of extra A, C, D, and 9-volt batteries should be maintained by the Supplies & Equipment Officer.








11. Protocol

11.1            Protocol: Dispatch



11.1.1 Rapid Response â€“ Crewmembers on call are expected to respond to the ambulance or crew rendezvous point within 15 minutes of tone out by State Comm.



11.1.2      Toned Out â€“ Let State Communication know that you are responding:



â€œMores Creek Portable 17 responding"; or â€œMores Creek Portable 5 responding directly to Highway 21, Milepost 22 in private vehicle.



If you know that other crewmembers are also responding, include them in your response. Ask questions as necessary:



â€œMores Creek Portables 1 and 2 now responding with ambulance to Jensensâ€™ residence in Robie Creek; ETA 10 minutes. State Comm, do you have any updated patient information?"



11.1.3 Coordinating Our Response â€“ Lead EMT's (if designated on schedule) coordinate responders on Channel 2:



â€œLead EMT, Portable 3 is at the Ambulance; I will meet Portable 9 on location at Highway 21, Milepost 20; I will pick up portable 2 at the Wilderness Ranch Office. Mores Creek ambulance now enroute.â€



11.1.4      Drive to Ambulance Building and Park there â€“ Drive safely to the ambulance location; another accident will most certainly delay our response. When parking your personal vehicle at the ambulance building, please be sure you do not block the ambulance building driveway or garage door.





11.2            Protocol: Responding to the Scene



11.2.1 First Member at Ambulance â€“ Before starting the ambulance, look around for obstacles, large leaks, open doors, etc. Visually check tires. Remove external electrical cable. Turn main driver side switch on. Turn ignition key half way and wait for the "Wait to Start" light to go out before starting ambulance.



Adjust rearview mirrors. Load any special equipment or supplies needed. Wait for other on-call responder(s) to arrive, be sure not to leave your partner(s) behind.



11.2.2 All Aboard? â€“ When all team members have arrived, confirm that everyone is onboard and buckled up. Turn off all portable radios to prevent feedback (in cab area), making sure that the ambulance radio is on and set to State EMS f2 for State Comm traffic. Proceed and maintain the speed limit---remember that our building is in a residential area and the speed limit is 15 MPH!



11.2.3Person Riding Shotgun â€“ The person riding shotgun is the navigator and maintains radio communications, freeing the driver to drive. Tell State Comm MCA is enroute, echoing destination, and request latest information:



â€œState Comm, Mores Creek Ambulance is now enroute with Portables 2 and 8 to Highway 21, Milepost 26. Do you have updated information?â€



11.2.4      Plan Ahead â€“ Discuss whatâ€™s known about the situation so far, and decide who will do what and the equipment that will be needed.

11.2.5Lights and Siren to Respond to Scene â€“ Use them as warranted by severity of call as follows:

Emergency Response â€“ State Law requires responding with lights and sirens.

Non-Emergency Response â€“ No lights or sirens

Remember that use of the siren can aggravate the patient's condition. Use of the siren should be limited to situations where absolutely necessary.



11.2.6      Drive Defensively â€“ The posted speed limit may be too fast at night, in bad weather, in heavy traffic, or on winding, bumpy roads. Excessive speed does not buy much time.

Example: To drive south on the winding section of Highway 21 form Milepost 29 to 20 at 50 mph instead of 45 mph saves only 1 minute!

Be especially alert for drivers who slam on their brakes and stop in the middle of the road when they see an ambulance approaching. Use the PA (right side of console) to advise them of a safer parking location.



11.3            Protocol: On Location

11.3.1      Arriving on Scene â€“ Advise State Comm that MCA is on location. Report circumstances not yet known by State Comm.

Example: â€œMores Creek Ambulance on location. Accident is at Milepost 25, not 24. A large tanker truck is leaking gasoline into creek; we request fire truck and HAZMAT crew.â€

Pick a safe place to park. Turn on scene lights and flashers as appropriate. Note the best way out. Turn portable radios on and carry them with you.

11.3.2      Securing the Scene â€“ Be alert for hazardous materials, downed power lines, children, people carrying weapons, etc. When responding to a shooting, domestic altercation, etc., it is necessary to wait for law enforcement to declare the scene safe before entering.

11.3.3      Driverâ€™s Primary Responsibilities â€“ The driverâ€™s primary responsibilities include securing the scene, ambulance security, and helping transport equipment to the patient. The driver can also monitor and answer radio traffic. Driver coordinates with law enforcement and other agencies, and guides Life Flight and other units to the scene. Drivers can also assist EMTâ€™s with patient care and gather information for the Patient Care Report.

11.3.4      Primary Responsibilities of EMTâ€™s â€“ The primary responsibilities of the EMTâ€™s include patient care, medical reports, and triage. Arriving EMTâ€™s are to take over for any first responder EMTâ€™s on scene unless that first responder EMT happens to be on the call schedule at the time. Each scene has only one lead EMT. But patients are always our patients, never mine, or yours.

11.3.5      Entire Crew â€“ The entire crew should be alert for non-obvious patients (the â€œwalking woundedâ€), continuing hazards, forensic evidence, and changing conditions.

11.3.6Preparing to Transport â€“ Patients should be packaged and secured. Driver rounds up all equipment and returns it to the ambulance. Before moving the vehicle, drivers confirm that everyone is aboard and secured, and that all compartments are closed. Driver double-checks the exit route and requests assistance backing-up if needed.





11.4            Protocol: Ground Transportation

11.4.1      Personal Ground Transportation â€“ Personal ground transportation of a patient to a hospital by a member is not allowed. If a patient elects not to take ambulance or air ambulance, they may provide for their own transport at their own risk.

11.4.2      Leaving the Scene â€“ Advise State Comm when the ambulance leaves the scene. Any of the initial responders can do this:

Example: â€œState Comm, MCA now leaving the scene with three patients from accident, all in stable condition. Standby for patient updates. ETA to St. Alâ€™s 45 minutes.â€

11.4.3      Patient Updates â€“ Patient updates are more in-depth reports to the receiving hospital. Be complete yet concise. Use plain English. The EMT should start transmitting information concerning the most serious patient first:

Example: â€œPatient #1 is a 40-year old male involved in an MVA. Chief complaints are pain in center of chest and right ribs, and pain in right ankle; possible fractured ribs and dislocated ankle. No other apparent injuries. Airway is clear. Patient is alert; BP 130/70, pulse 80 and full. Respiration 16 and clear. Pupils equal and reactive. Adequate circulation in both feet and full neurological response. Patient on 12 liters oxygen by mask. ETA to St. Alâ€™s 40 minutes.â€

Then wait 15 seconds to give other radio traffic a chance to get on the air before giving an update for the second-most-serious Patient #2.

11.4.4      When you are 10 minutes out â€“ Call the hospital with your final update (at Micron for St. Alâ€™s or at the Crows Inn for St. Lukes or the VA). Call all hospitals on State Comm channel f1.

11.4.5      Lights & Siren for Ground Transport â€“

Urgency Code Green - no lights or sirens

Urgency Code Yellow - Lights only on Highway; town: no lights

Urgency Code Red/blue - Lights and Sirens

State Comm can arrange green lights through downtown. Request this at the Crows Inn, and be prepared to give your location as you approach Warm Springs and Broadway. Be extra careful when running traffic that has been held up by the red lights. The easiest way to St. Alâ€™s is Highway 21 â€“ I 84 â€“ the Connector â€“ Curtis exit.

11.4.5 Arriving at Hospital â€“ Hospital driveways are often congested, and people may be preoccupied. Be especially careful around the hospitals. When pulling into the driveway, tell State Comm that MCA has arrived:

Example: â€œ State Comm, Mores Creek Ambulance at St. Lukeâ€™s.â€

At St. Alâ€™s and St. Lukeâ€™s, the entry code for the emergency entrance is 7079#



11.5 Protocol: At the Hospital

11.5.1 Unloading Patients â€“ Unload the most critical patient first. If necessary, you should have asked for help unloading while calling the hospital 10 minutes ahead of arrival. (See SOP 11.4.3) The driver stays with the patient(s) remaining in the ambulance. Patientâ€™s personal belongings (including medications) should follow the patient, or, if turned over to hospital staff, that staff member's name should be noted on the PCR.

11.5.2      Bring a Radio â€“ Drivers should remember to bring a portable radio along into the emergency room, just in case we get toned out again (in this event, inform State Comm that we are still at the hospital & are out of service). Be sure the radio is turned on.

11.5.3Park Ambulance â€“ After all patients have been unloaded, driver parks the ambulance where it will not obstruct other vehicles.

11.5.4Inside Hospital â€“ EMTâ€™s should give full patient report to the attending physician. Do not leave the patient until released by the physician & have the physician sign the PCR.

Example: â€œThis is Ms. Verlene Smith of Robie Creek. Her chief complaint is sharp pain in the right hip. She has been stable with good vitals for the past hour. Other information is on the run sheet.â€

11.5.5Look and Learn â€“ Crewmembers can ask to assist hospital staff. It is a great way to learn, and most nurses and physicians are cooperative. Be tactful. Offer relevant information from your field observations â€“ without sounding like Joe Diagnosis.

11.5.6Patient Goodwill â€“ If patients are conscious and available, it is professional courtesy to wish them well before we leave. A patientâ€™s family may also appreciate our best wishes. (A subtle reminder to them that we are an all-volunteer outfit.)

11.5.7Finish Run Sheets â€“ State Comm can give you the times. Call them by a landline phone.

11.5.8Clean Ambulance â€“ Use hospital-cleaning supplies to clean the ambulance. Replenish soiled linen, repack equipment, etc. Make arrangements to have reusable equipment (backboards, C-collars, etc.) returned to MCA. To the extent possible, prepare the ambulance to encounter another call while returning to the Mores Creek area.

11.5.9Before Leaving the Hospital â€“ Walk around the ambulance to make sure there is nothing to run over and that all compartments are closed.

11.6            Protocol: Team Response

We must assume that all requests for MCA services are, or could develop into, genuine emergencies.

Therefore, our minimum response to any call will be the ambulance with at least one EMT and one driver. The ambulance will leave with one person aboard only if he or she knows for sure that a partner is also enroute to the scene.

Responders must coordinate closely to avoid having a lone, non-EMT driver arrive first on scene.

In case of a motor vehicle accident in the Mores Creek response area, the MCA crew will need to request the Wilderness Ranch Extrication Unit from (1) Boise County Sheriff or (2) State Comm.

11.6.1 State Comm Information â€“ All requests for MCA services must be toned out through State Comm. That way, everyone monitoring a radio will know whatâ€™s going on and can prepare to assist if necessary, and be on standby for a possible second call.

If an MCA member gets a call some other way (knock on the door, personal phone call, being first on scene, etc.), he or she should to attempt to activate the EMS system.

Always ask State Comm to echo all important radio traffic about any call.

11.6.2      Requests for EMTâ€™s only â€“ Anyone who receives a request for an â€œEMT onlyâ€ should politely offer that weâ€™d be glad to respond with the ambulance, explaining that we always go out in pairs. If the caller refuses our standard response, we should immediately landline (or radio, if phone is not available) State Comm and explain to them what happened. That way, if the callerâ€™s situation worsens and they end up calling for help later, State Comm will know whatâ€™s going on.

All reports to State Comm are recorded on tape. Thatâ€™s good to know, just in case the patient later complains that the â€œMores Creek EMT told me that it was not seriousâ€ or that â€œthe Mores Creek EMTâ€™s refused to help me.â€

11.6.3No Freelancing â€“ A member who treats a patient without backup of the EMS system accepts sole responsibility for that treatment.

11.6.4      Non-member Driving â€“ Only active MCA members (who have completed an orientation drive of the ambulance as described in SOP 2.4) can drive our vehicle(s).

11.6.5      Exception â€“ The only exception is when all MCA members on a scene agree that a particular nonâ€“member can drive safely, and that having this non-member drive is the only way to save the life, limb, or eyes of a patient at a scene.



11.7      Protocol: Do Not Resuscitate Orders (DNR's)

11.7.1DNR's -- Do Not Resuscitate Orders are issued by Physicians to terminally ill patients so they can die with dignity at home. In Idaho this type of order is called a â€œComfort Oneâ€ order. MCA will follow all current Idaho EMS protocols regarding DNRâ€™s.




12. Ordering & Stocking Supplies

12.1            Obtaining supplies â€“ Officers are charged with obtaining equipment and supplies required for MCA operation. Any expense over $25.00, or being purchased by a member who is not on the board, shall require prior board authorization.
